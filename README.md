# 1 Front-end a Day

1 Front-end a Day is a challenge started by me to improve my coding skills through making 1 front-end project on a daily basis.

## How does it work?

Everyday, I will set a time limit for myself to completely code a front-end design made by other designers. The design is retrieved from free resources website either in a form of figma files or .jpeg/.png. The websites are:

- https://frontendmentor.io/
- More to come...

## What I want to achieve

- Improve my speed in developing front-end code.
- Learn a CSS framework (Tailwind).
- Improve my design thinking by 'repainting' design made by other designers.

## Tech stacks

For the challenge, I will mostly be using:

- React
- Next.js
- CSS/SCSS/Styled Components
